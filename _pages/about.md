Siyuan Liang (梁思远) focuses on long-context modeling and recurrent architectures for sequence models, and proposed the Block-wise Recurrent Transformer (Memory Attention) for strong length extrapolation under train-short, test-long settings.

Previously, he worked as an algorithm researcher at Megvii in Beijing, delivering production algorithms for fingerprint and face liveness, display demura, and XR hand tracking.

He received his M.S. in Electronic and Communication Engineering from Xidian University, where his research centered on deep-learning-based radar anti-jamming detection and intelligent electromagnetic games.
